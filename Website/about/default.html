					I&#39;m a software developer who happens to live board games. 
					Oddly enough, I like to make computer games out of board 
					games more than I like to actually play them.</p>
				<p>
					<em>NOTE: If you don&#39;t know much about computer programming 
					or computer science the rest of this about is not going to 
					make a lick of sense.</em></p><p>As with most side 
				programming projects, there isn&#39;t enough time in the day so only 
				the best of projects every actually get done. I started writing 
				Coloretta several years ago and have stopped, started, 
				restarted, stopped, and then restarted work in it. It was until 
				two months ago that I wanted to try writing a card based came 
				that used a completely immutable design pattern. I plan on 
				writing a blog about the advantages and disadvantages however in summary
				 I think it has been a big help in both 
				debugging AND allowing me to write the entire library in just a 
				few weeks.</p><p>I&#39;m putting this game out on the web hoping 
				it&#39;ll bring some enjoyment to people. I&#39;ve put a Donate link on 
				just about every page. Anything I get will be put towards the 
				cost of future webhosting and will not be used to compensate 
				myself.</p>
				<p>Let me know what you think of the game!</p>
				<p>Happy Coloretta-ing!</p>
