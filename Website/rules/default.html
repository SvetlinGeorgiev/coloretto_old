				<p>
					As with most games, the goal of Coloretta is to get the most 
					points. Points are obtained by collecting as many cards of 
					the same color as possible however too much variety in 
					colors will cost you points. (I&#39;ll explain more about it 
					in scoring)</p><p id="RoundSetup"><strong>Round Setup</strong>
				</p>
				<div class="subparagraph">
					Each round starts with each player 
					getting a different color dealt to them. In addition, if 
					there are three players there will be three game stacks setup, four stacks for 4 players, etc.&nbsp; 
				</div>
				<div class="subparagraph">
					The deck is randomized and the &quot;Last 
					Cycle&quot; card is placed 15 cards from the 
					bottom. The deck consists of 63 color cards (7 different 
					colors and 9 cards of each), 10 &#39;+2&#39; cards, and 3 wilds. <br />
					<br />
					<em>NOTE: A 3 player game uses 6 colors rather than 7.</em></div>
				<div id="GamePlay" style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;">Game Play</div>
				<div class="subparagraph">
					The first player is determined randomly. A player has two 
					options on their turn. Either drawing from the deck and 
					placing the card on a game stack <strong>*or*</strong> picking a game stack.
				</div>
				<div class="subparagraph">
					<span id="Drawing"><em><strong>Draw from the deck and placing a card</strong></em></span>
					<div class="subparagraph">
						A player must draw from the deck if all of the game 
						stacks are empty.
					</div>
					<div class="subparagraph">
						A player may not place 
						the card on a stack that a player has picked up. 
						(Once everyone has picked up a stack then the cycle 
						is complete and all stacks are &#39;empty&#39; again.)
					</div>
					<div class="subparagraph">A game stack is full once it has 3 
						cards in it. A card cannot be placed on a full stack.</div>
					<div class="subparagraph">
						A player cannot draw from the deck if all un-picked game 
						stacks are full. 					</div>
					<div style="margin-top: 10px">
						<span id="Picking"><em><strong>Pick a game stack</strong></em></span>
						<div class="subparagraph">
							Instead of drawing a card the player may choose to 
							pick one of the game stacks. Picking a game stack 
							places the cards in the selected stack into the 
							player&#39;s hand.</div>
							<div class="subparagraph">A player cannot pick an 
								empty stack. </div>
							<div class="subparagraph">After picking a stack the 
								player does not get another turn until all 
								players have picked a stack. After all players 
								have selected a stack a new &#39;cycle&#39; starts.</div>
						<div class="subparagraph">Once a stack has been picked 
							it is deactivated until the next cycle.&nbsp;In each 
							&#39;cycle&#39; each stack will be selected by different 
							players which is why there are as many stacks as 
							there are players. </div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div style="margin-top:10px;" id="Scoring"><strong>Scoring</strong></div>
				<div class="subparagraph">Scoring is not final until the round 
					is over. The round is over when the cycle in which the &quot;Last Cycle&quot; card is 
					drawn is finished. At this time the player&#39;s hand score is 
					added to the player&#39;s previous round scores. The player&#39;s hand is cleared 
					and another round is setup. There are 4 rounds in a game by 
					default.</div>
				<div class="subparagraph">Scoring is based on Fibonacci numbers 
					and how many cards of in set you have. (Cards are grouped 
					into a sets based on color.)&nbsp; The <strong>three</strong> 
					largest sets are added up and 
					any remaining sets are a subtracted as a penalty. It is to your 
					advantage to select game stacks that will make your hand 
					contain no more than three different colors although you&#39;ll 
					probably always have more than three colors. <em>NOTE: As 
					you can see in the scoring chart below. Getting more than 6 
					cards in a set does not give you more points.</em></div>
					<div class="subparagraph">If the player has any wild cards then 
						they are grouped in color sets that will 
						give the player the most points.&nbsp; A wild card will 
						never be grouped with a color set that would subtract 
						points.</div>
						<div class="subparagraph">+2 cards add 2 points to the 
							player&#39;s hand.</div>
							<div class="subparagraph">Although the player would 
								have to have horrible luck, it is possible to get a negative score.</div>
